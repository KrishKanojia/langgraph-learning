1. LangGraph can handle complex workflow like decision making, looping and jump to another workflow step.
2. LangGraph is stateful means state help in decision making between workflow step. Update state is pass between each LangGraph's node.
3. LangGraph is event driven, it can perform action after specific event is triggered (for e.g. wait for 7 days to evaluate submitted CV)
4. Fault Tolerant in LangGraph even after failure of execution, LangGraph has ability to perform same operation after some time.
5. Human in the loop in LangGraph to pause chain and wait for human interaction to continue
6. Nested Workflow in LangGraph 
7. Observability refers to how easily you can monitor, debug and understand what your workflow at runtime.
